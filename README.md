# Fruit-Classifier
CSE-342,IIITD
This project aims to apply the learned concepts from Statistical Machine Learning(CSE-342) to a real-world problem of fruit classification. We have a dataset of 1216 samples, each with 4096 features, that belongs to 20 different types of fruits. Our task is to train a model to predict the fruit category for the testing data accurately. This competition was hosted on Kaggle as part of our course curriculum ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sml-project/)).
